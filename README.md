# Colour Game - Test Your Reflexes and Memory!
This project is a fast-paced, Python-based word-colour association game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It challenges players to type the **colour of the word** displayed, not the text itself, testing reflexes and cognitive skills. It includes a leaderboard, progress tracking, and insightful AI-driven feedback for players to improve their performance.

# Features
- **Exciting Gameplay**: A 30-second game where players match colours, not words, for points.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Updates your score and progress as you play.
- **Leaderboard**: Automatically saves and displays top player scores.
- **AI-Driven Feedback**: Provides insights on accuracy, streak performance, and comparison to top players.
- **Streak Analysis**: Tracks your highest streak during the game to motivate consistent performance.
- **Custom Progress Ba**r: Visual representation of the remaining time.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language.
- Tkinter: GUI framework.
- Numpy: Used for average response time calculations.
- File Handling: To save and retrieve leaderboard data.

# Leaderboard File Format
The leaderboard data is saved in a text file (leaderboard.txt) with the following structure:

1. John Doe: 12
2. Jane Smith: 15
3. Player One: 10

This file updates automatically at the end of each game and is used to display the top scores.

# Gameplay Overview
1. **Objective**: Type the colour of the word displayed on the screen (not the text).
2. **Scoring**: Earn 1 point for each correct input.
3. **Timer**: You have 30 seconds to score as many points as possible.
4. **Feedback**: At the end of the game, receive insights into your performance:
- Accuracy (% of correct responses).
- Highest streak of consecutive correct answers.
- Reaction time analysis.
- Comparison to the average score of top players on the leaderboard.

# Why You’ll Love It
Are you quick on your feet and ready for a mental challenge? This game is a great way to sharpen your reflexes while having fun! Compete with friends and climb the leaderboard, or challenge yourself to beat your highest streak and accuracy scores. It’s a fast, fun, and engaging test of cognitive coordination.

# Why I Built This
I wanted to create a fun and interactive way to demonstrate my skills in Python, GUI development, and data handling. By integrating AI-driven feedback and performance tracking, this project highlights my ability to combine engaging design with practical analysis tools. It's a perfect example of how programming can make games not just entertaining but also insightful!

Try to beat my score! ☺️
